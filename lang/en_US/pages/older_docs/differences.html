<h2>  
GoboLinux: What makes it unique? 
</h2>  

<p>
GoboLinux has a directory structure different from other
Linux distributions. In GoboLinux, all files for a program, including
executables, headers and libraries, are installed
below a single directory that belongs to that program. So the <pre>ping</pre> utility might reside in
</p>  

<pre>  
/Programs/Netkit-Base/0.17/bin/ping  
</pre>
<p>
and <pre>libpng.so.3</pre> in 
</p>
<pre>
/Programs/LibPNG/1.2.5/lib/libpng.so.3  
</pre>
<p>  
To be visible to other software, these files are symlinked
into standard locations in the
new directory hierarchy under <tt>/System/Index</tt>: 
</p>  
<pre>  
/System/Index/bin/ping
/System/Index/lib/libpng.so.3
</pre>  
<p>  
Traditional Unix paths are also symlinks to the <tt>/System/Index</tt>  
directory structure:  
</p>  
<pre>  
/bin -> /System/Index/bin
/usr/bin -> /System/Index/bin
/usr/lib -> /System/Index/lib
</pre>  
<p>
So for example, a shell script 
expecting to run <tt>/usr/bin/ping</tt>, will continue to
do so under GoboLinux.
</p>
<p>
This architecture -- installing each program under its own
directory, and making executables, headers other resources available 
via symlinks -- has significant advantages:
<ul>
<li>different versions  of libraries can coexist</li>
<li> it's trivial to uninstall software</li>
<li> there is no need for a package database.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In fact, the scope of the task of managing software with
this organization is so constrained that most utility
programs needed to adminster the system could be reasonably
implemented as shell scripts, which GoboLinux developers
chose to do.
</p>
<p>
Managing dependency relations among software is accomplished
through the <a href="?page=compile">GoboLinux build
system</a> and its library 
of <a href="?page=recipes">"compile recipes"</a>.
